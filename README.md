- **CV Text**: Your uploaded CV content
- **Settings**: Azure OpenAI configuration (endpoint, API key, deployment)
- **Tracker**: Up to 200 job entries with analysis results

### Privacy & Security

## Limitations & Known Issues

### MVP Limitations

1. **CV Format**: Currently only supports `.txt` files
   - PDF and DOCX parsing will be added in future versions
   - Workaround: Convert your CV to plain text

2. **Content Extraction**: May not work perfectly on all websites
   - Some sites with complex layouts may extract extra content
   - The extension tries to identify main content areas

3. **API Costs**: Each analysis calls Azure OpenAI API
   - Be mindful of API usage costs
   - Consider the cost per analysis based on your Azure pricing

4. **Tracker Limit**: Maximum 200 jobs stored
   - Oldest entries are automatically removed when limit is reached

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to extract page content"
- Make sure you're on a page with substantial text content
- Some sites may block content extraction
- Try refreshing the page and clicking analyze again

### "Analysis failed: Connection error"
- Check your Azure OpenAI settings in Settings
- Verify your API key is correct and has not expired
- Test connection using "Test Connection" button
- Check that your deployment name matches Azure

### "Please upload your CV first"
- Click "📄 Upload CV" and select your `.txt` CV file
- Check CV Status in Settings to verify upload

### Extension doesn't work on specific sites
- Some sites use shadow DOM or iframes which may block content extraction
- Try using the extension on the direct job posting page, not search results

## Development

### Local Development

The extension is ready to use in development mode. To modify:

1. Make changes to source files
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click the refresh icon on the extension card
4. Test your changes

### Building for Production

For production deployment:

1. Replace placeholder icons in `icons/` folder with proper PNG icons
2. Review and minimize permissions if possible
3. Test thoroughly on various job sites
4. Consider adding analytics (privacy-respecting)
5. Package for Chrome Web Store
